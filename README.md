#I believe that we will win... if a few conditions are met

**THE GOAL** is to predict what strengths the Tennessee Titans must have in order to finish the season with a winning record. 

**THE DATASET** I have is from Sunshine Forecast, and lists cumulative NFL statistic dating back to 2000, just one year since The Titan's only super-bowl visit (and loss). http://www.repole.com/sun4cast/data.html#dataprior
1. The data comes in CSV files seperated by season, and then by game with each row within each CSV being a game from that season. 
2. Each observation or row contains the stats of each team's offense and defense that played, one starting to the right of the column "TeamName" and the other to the right of "Opponent". 
3. The data seems to be extremely complete, and is already seperated. I don't see any documentation on the site, so there might be questions about some of the column names. 

I chose this topic because I'm a diehard Tennessee Titans fan, and simply put, I'm tired of mediocity. I want to find out what consistnely helps us to (or inhibits us from) winning so that way I can send my findings to our new owner, who probably makes acquisitions with his gut, and not with machine learning.
